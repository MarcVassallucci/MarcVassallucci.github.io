You will find here some of the projects I worked on.

## KITTY JOURNEY

Kitty Journey is a released mobile puzzle game.

I worked on multiple parts of the game :
- **AI** : assists that pick the best possible targets according to the game state and the level goals
- **backend** : allowing player to share lifes, custom analytics
- **automatization** : auto build and deploy tool, generating an enum to avoid fetching assets by name, faster integration with import scripts
- **UI**

## BOTKEN

Botken is an online mobile fighting game still in development.

I worked on the networking of the game.
The main constraints were :
* making the gameplay code independent from the engine, allowing it to run on a very lightweight server
* having a smooth experience at 250ms when playing over 3G
