Hi !

![image-title-here](/MarcVassallucci.github.io/static/img/avatar.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

I'm a gameplay programmer with additional skills in 3D and art.

I've been in the game industry for one year and shipped a mobile game on which I did gameplay and UI programming.
I also worked on an online real-time fighting game, and was tasked to coming up with solutions to latency and cheating.

I'm used to meeting with art and design teams to find technical solutions to their needs.
In addition I can speak french and english, and use common source control tools and project tracking softwares.

I have a degree in computer science with a specialty in machine learning and networking.
Before going to the university I studied animation, 2D and 3D art during a few years.

I'm a game jam enthusiast and took part to around nine of them over the last few years, being in the top three in two of them.
