You will find here some of the projects I worked on.

## KITTY JOURNEY

Kitty Journey is a released mobile puzzle game.

I worked on multiple parts of the game :
- **AI** : improved auto-targetting by using a weight based heuristic
- **backend** : setting up a server and a database to allow players to exchange game items
- **automatization** : automatized the build and deployment processes, wrote various unity import scripts to speed up asset integration
- **UI** : designed complex UI components

## BOTKEN

Botken is an online mobile fighting game still in development.

I worked on the networking of the game.
The main constraints were :
* making the gameplay code independent from the engine libraries, allowing it to run on a very lightweight server
* having a smooth experience at 250ms when playing over 3G
