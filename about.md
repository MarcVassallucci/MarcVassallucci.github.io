Hi !

I'm a gameplay programmer with additional skills in 3D and art.

I've been in the game industry for one year and shipped a mobile game on which I did gameplay and UI programming.
I also worked on an online real-time fighting game, and was tasked to coming up with solutions to latency and cheating.

I'm used to meeting with art and design teams to find technical solutions to their needs.
In addition I can speak french and english, and use common source control tools and project tracking softwares.

I have a degree in computer science with a specialty in machine learning and networking.
Before going to the university I studied animation, 2D and 3D art during a few years.

I'm a game jam enthusiast and took part to around nine of them over the last few years, being in the top three in two of them.

## KITTY JOURNEY

Kitty Journey is a released mobile puzzle game.

I worked on multiple parts of the game :
- **AI** : assists that pick the best possible targets according to the game state and the level goals
- **backend programming** : allowing player to share lifes, custom analytics
- **tools programming** : auto build and deploy tool, generating an enum to avoid fetching assets by name, faster integration with import scripts
- **UI programming**

## BOTKEN

Botken is an online mobile fighting game still in development.

I worked on the networking of the game.
The main constraints were :
* making the gameplay code independent from the engine, allowing it to run on a very lightweight server
* having a smooth experience at 250ms when playing over 3G
